# Definition
* Databse Replication = It helps to 1) Fault tolerance 2) Reduce Latency 3) Increase performance
* Database Synchronous = 
* Database Asynchronous = 
* Consistancy Models OR Consistancy Alogirithams = Read After Write Consistancy
* Replication Lag = 
* Synchronous Replication = All replicas have to be updated before host is acknowledged
* Asynchronous Replication = Host is acknowledged after primary DB is updated. Replicas update asynchronously
* Semi Synchronous Replication = 
* Databse Snapshot = Taking the state of Database at certain point of time

# Database Replication Ways
1. Periodic Replication ( for ex : job runs for every 1 min / 1 hour )
2. Change Data Capture ( CDC ) --- Captures changes made in a database and ensures that those changes are replicated to a destination database
3. Partial Replication
